# DevOps-Certification
DevOps is a term for a group of concepts that, have catalyzed into a movement and are rapidly spreading throughout the technical community. 
I propose this definition as a term that emerged from the collision of two major related trends. 
The first was also called “agile infrastructure” or “agile operations”, it sprang from applying Agile and lean approaches to operations work. 
The second is a much-expanded understanding of the value of collaboration between development and operations staff throughout all stages of the development lifecycle when creating and operating a service. 
The third is the Quality assurance where the quality and the performance is measured.
